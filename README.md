Serverless File Analyzer (AWS Simulation)

A complete cloud-inspired project built in Python that simulates AWS services without needing actual cloud access.

✨ Features

📂 S3 Simulation → Upload & store files locally,
⚙️ Lambda Function → Automatically processes files & extracts metadata,
🗄️ DynamoDB Mock → Stores metadata in structured JSON format,
📜 CloudWatch Logs → Logs every event with timestamps,
🌍 API Gateway Simulation → JSON-based request/response flow,
🖼️ Architecture Diagram → Visual representation of the system.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 3.x (no external dependencies),
Organized project structure (easy to run in VS Code),
End-to-end simulation: from upload → process → store → log

💡 Why this project?
To show that cloud learning is not bound by credit cards or consoles — it’s about understanding the flow and simulating it until the real thing becomes second nature.
