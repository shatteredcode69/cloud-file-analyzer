🌩️ Serverless File Analyzer (AWS Simulation)

A hands-on project that simulates AWS serverless architecture — built entirely in Python without the need for cloud access.
This project demonstrates how API Gateway, Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, and CloudWatch come together in a seamless flow.

“Clouds may drift, but the architecture we build upon them remains our story.”

✨ Features

📂 S3 Simulation → Upload and store files locally

⚙️ Lambda Function → Processes files and extracts metadata automatically

🗄️ DynamoDB Mock → Stores structured metadata in JSON format

📜 CloudWatch Logs → Logs all events with timestamps for easy tracing

🌍 API Gateway Simulation → Request/response flow for triggering file analysis

🖼️ Architecture Diagram → Clear visual representation (architecture.png)

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 3.x (no external dependencies)

Organized project structure (modular & easy to extend)

Fully runnable in VS Code: No AWS account or credit card needed
